fastrandom - fast random source for (over)writing disk partitions/images

Filling up the storage to be used as source for dmcrypt using the
output from /dev/urandom can take a long time since the latter is
quite slow. openssl rand is said to be a couple times faster, but I
figured that I'd like something still faster than that, here's the
result.

It intends to be using complementary-multiply-with-carry by George
Marsaglia [1], taking the code posted at [2], although on the latter
page there has been discussion of not understanding that
implementation. So, this is *ALPHA* code, don't rely on it...

In an attempt to ensure even distribution even if the used algorithm
is partially faulty, the program is mixing in some output from
/dev/urandom into the result. This, too, may or may not actually be
safe.

The resulting program is fast enough for my purpose, it generates
about 100MB/s output on an Atom D510 @ 1.66GHz.
